# landing-page
landing page project for The Odin Project

This is my attempt at the landing page project for The Odin Project. 

In this project I hope to demonstrate the following skills:

    * Use of display's such as flex and/or block and inline.
    * Use of alignment using justify-content and align-items.
    * Understanding and use of axes.
    * Improved understanding of HTML structure using div's to create containers.
